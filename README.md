# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
***
In this project, we will combine and practice implementing what we have learned throughout this course, including:

* Turning data into easily consumable visual insights, using Tableau

* Creating impactful dashboards that help stakeholders make decisions, based on a business questions
  
* Communicating insights with the correct visualizations

***
## Process

***
* Part 1: Connecting to source data: (add dataset to tableau)
* Part 2: Questions to answer: (what features are important)
* Part 3: Drag different features into rows and columns (make graphs)
* Part 4: Add a legend (use show me tables and add filters) 
* Part 5: Make a dashboard
***

## Results
Option 2

FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015:
This is a cleaned table of wildlife strikes from 2000-2015 in the United States. Visit the FAA Wildlife Strike Database which contains records of wildlife strikes reported by airlines, airports, pilots, and other sources. The dataset is available here as faa_data_subset.xlsx

* Visualizations were line charts, bar charts, maps, treemaps, text tables, and horizontal bars. 
* Used these visualizations as it made it easier to see which states were being affected by what.
* Main question: What was the damage per state and Who was more affected? I went through the prompts by focusing on the 3 features: effect, when, wildlife. I used my question and broke it into more insights and made graphs based on those!

(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
* nothing being created when having rows and columns, abc values showing up
* pie chart had way too many categories so could not use it
* at the beginning did not what questions to answer
* understanding what features were important


## Future Goals
* more visualizations and answer different questions
* check with most recent wildfire data
* try to make more predictions on wildfires that was gonna happen
* see which species started becoming endangered due to wildfire strikes
